1. Conduct a t-test using the “head corn” yield data shown below. Can you guess/explain where the 14:1 odds come from?
The 14:1 odds may come from an examination of the p value, which is 0.06091. With 14:1 odds, you have a 93.33% probability of one outcome happening and a 6.67% of the other outcome happening.
```{r}
# 1. Conduct a t-test using the “head corn” yield data shown below. Can you guess/explain where the 14:1 odds come from?

# Ho: The two types of seed will have no difference in mean yields.
#Ha: Kiln dried seeds will have a greater mean yield than non kild dried seeds.

2. Test whether the mean concentration has changed with remediation. Test whether the wells downgradient of remediation are significantly lower in molybdenum than the upgradient wells. 

The p-value of our two tailed is 0.01041, which is smaller than our alpha of 0.05, so we reject the null and say there is a significant difference between upgradient and downgradient values.

The p-value of our one tailed is 0.005206, which is smaller than our alpha of 0.05, then we reject the null. The downgradient values are significantly lower than the upgradient wells.

3. Does the North Fork, which drains terrain with calcareous (more soluble) minerals have higher conductance than the South Fork, which drains terrain with quartz-rich (less soluble) minerals?

A. State the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses to see if conductance values are the same in the two forks.
Ho: There is no difference in mean conductance between the South Fork and North Fork.
u_NF - U_SF = 0

Ha: The North Fork has a higher mean conductance than the South Fork.
u_NF - u_SF > 0

B. Determine whether a parametric or nonparametric test should be used.
The plots are approximately normal when graphed, the variance is reasonably homogenous (0.5 < 1.1 < 2), and the observations are independent. Therefore we can use a parametric test.

C. Compute an α=0.05 test and report the results.
The p-value is 0.03373, which is less than our alpha of 0.05, so we can conclude that the North Fork does have a significantly higher conductance than the South Fork.
t: 1.9458
p-value: 0.03373
alpha: 0.05
df: 18

D. Estimate the amount by which the forks differ in conductance, regardless of the test outcome.
The median conductance of the forks differs by about 65 micrograms/liter.

E. Illustrate and check the results with a plot.
The plots confirm my findings that the means are different.

4. Determine whether the pH of samples taken from three sets of piezometers are identical. If not identical, which groups are different from others? Which are contaminated? Be sure to check the normality and equal variance assumptions of ANOVA if using this parametric method.
Independent: group name (classified as item)
Dependent: pH values (classified as numeric)
The pH values are not identical because the p-value of 0.00209 is less than I alpha I set of 0.05. Using the Tukey method, I can see that there is a significant difference between groups 1 and 2, as well as groups 3 and 2. Since group 2 is significantly different from both of the other groups, I am going to say that is the one group that is not contaminated.

5. Determine whether chloride concentrations differ among springs emanating from the three rock types. If differences occur, which rock types differ from the others? Check the assumptions of ANOVA before using it.
Chloride concentrations do differ between rock types according to an ANOVA. The p value of 0.0231 is less than the the alpha I assigned of 0.05. Using the Tukey method, I determined that grano and ephemer are significantly different from each other. We can see that because in the plot the bars do not cross zero and the p-value of 0.0351578 is less than the alpha of 0.05 I assigned. The other two combinations have p-values greater than 0.05 and they do have lines that cross zero in the plot.

6. Test the Corbicula data to determine whether either season or year are significant factors for the number of organisms observed. If significant effects are found, test for which levels of the factor differ from others.
Both year and season have p-values less than the alpha I assigned of 0.05 (0.000986 and 5.69e-05 respectively) so they are each significant factors.For year, 1971 - 1969 has a p-value of 0.0006494 which is less than my alpha of 0.05 so that is a significant level. The other two have p-values greater than 0.05 so they are not significant. For season, Winter - Fall (p-value: 0.0007254), Winter-Spring (p-value: 0.0006643), and Winter-Summer (p-value: 0.0000959) are significant because their p-values are less than our alpha of 0.05. The other combinations have p-values greater than 0.05 so they are not significant.

7a. Are uranium concentrations correlated with total dissolved solids in the groundwater samples? If so, describe the strength of the relation.
There is a weak positive correlation between tds and uranium concentration in the groundwater samples, as the correlation coefficient is 0.216086. 

7b. Is the relation significant for α=0.1?
With an alpha of 0.1, the relation is significant because our p-value is 0.07945, which is less than our alpha.

CQ1. Using this information and dataset, determine whether at least one laboratory provided higher/lower results than the others. If so, determine which labs differ from others. Please include the following in your analysis:

A. Conduct a nonparametric test to determine if at least one laboratory is different from the others. In particular, use either the Friedman test OR the Aligned-ranks test (ART)
The p-value of 2.295e-08 is less than the alpha I assigned of 0.05. This means that at least one laboratory is different from the others.

B. With the samples as blocks, perform a two-way ANOVA without replication to decide whether at least one laboratory provided higher/lower results than the others. C. If you determine that there is a difference among the labs, Use a multiple comparison test (e.g., Tukey, Holm’s) to determine which labs differ from others E. Briefly summarize the results and conclusions of your analysis
According to my two way ANOVA without replication, there is not a significant difference between labs (p-value: 0.2770), but there is a significant difference between samples (p-value: 0.0104). This means that there are different results between the parametric and non parametric test.

CQ2. Using this information and dataset, determine whether tillage methods affect TP loading. Please include the following in your analysis:

A. Estimate the mean TP loading for each tillage method
Conventional has the largest TP loading, while no till has the smallest TP loading.
Conservation: 2.3
Conventional: 3.0
No till: 0.2
Pasture: 1.9

B. Discuss briefly whether logarithm transformation is necessary
The data is positively skewed as seen in the histogram of total phosphorus loading so a logarithmic transformation would be logical to do.

C. Use a statistical test to study whether different tillage methods resulted in different TP loading (state the null and alternative hypothesis, conduct the test, report the result).
I think given that the next section says to transform the data that the expectation for this section is to not transform the data before analysis despite it being skewed. Therefore I will use a nonparametric test.
Ho: There will be no difference in the mean TP load between methods.
Ha: There will be a difference in the mean TP load between methods.
Because this data is not normal, I would use a nonparametric test. I chose to use the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The p-value is 8.076e-13. Because the p-value is less than the alpha I set of 0.05, I reject the null and say there is a significant difference in TP loads between methods.

D. Fit two ANOVA models using (1.) log TP loading (log(TPLoad)) and (2) the square root of the square root of TP loading (TPLoad ^ 0.25) as the response and tillage method as the predictor.
I fit both ANOVA models; see below code.

E. Briefly summarize the results and conclusions of your analysis.
The logarithmic transformation had a p-value of 1.38e-12 and residuals sum of squares of 523.1. The square root transformation had a p-value of 1.38e-13 and a residuals sum of squares of 28.586. All of my tests, parametric and nonparametric, conclude that there is a significant difference between TP load and tillage method. The square root transformation appears to have provided the best test because it was combined with ANOVA, which is a parametric test and therefore stronger than the non parametric and allows us to make comments beyond the sample to the population, and it had a lower sum of squares for the residuals than the ANOVA done for the log transformation.
